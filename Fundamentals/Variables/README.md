# Chapter 2 : Variables

## What are Variables?

Variable is a symbolic name associated with a value and is used to store data in a program.

### Key Characteristics of Variables:

- **Storage**: Variables act as storage locations for data values.

- **Naming**: Each variable has a name (identifier) that you use to access its value. Variable names must follow certain rules:
  - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
  - Can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores.
  - Are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different variables).

- **Data Types**: Variables can store different types of data, including:
  - Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3)
  - Floats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
  - Strings: Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!")
  - Booleans: True or False values (e.g., True, False)

- **Dynamic Typing**: In languages like Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter determines the type based on the value assigned.

## Comments:

Comments in Python are used to explain code, making it easier to understand for yourself and others. They are ignored by the Python interpreter, meaning they do not affect the execution of the program. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how to use comments in Python:
- **Types of Comments in Python**:
1. Single-Line Comments: Single-line comments start with a hash mark (#).
2. Multi-Line Comments: You can use multiple single-line comments or triple quotes (""" or ''') to create a comment that spans multiple lines.

## Python Data Types in main.py

This document describes various data types used in the `main.py` file, along with the comments added in the code.

## What is Formatted String Literals?

Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by prefixing the string with f or F and writing expressions as {expression}.

### Key Features of f-strings:

- **Expression Support**: You can include any valid Python expression inside the braces.
- **Calling Functions**: You can call functions within the braces.
- **Formatting Options**: You can use format specifications for numbers and dates.
- **Multiline f-strings**: You can also use f-strings over multiple lines.

## F-Strings in f_string.py

- Opening quotes must be preceded by an f.
- Variables within curly brackets have their values "interpolated" (injected) into the string.
- It's just a string with a special syntax.

## What is clean code?

Clean code refers to programming practices that prioritize readability, simplicity, and maintainability. It emphasizes writing code that is easy to understand and modify, making it more accessible for both the original author and other developers who may work on it later.

### Key Principles of Clean Code

1. **Readability**:
   - Code should be easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names that convey purpose.

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Keep code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive for straightforward solutions.

3. **Consistency**:
   - Maintain a consistent style throughout the codebase. This includes naming conventions, formatting, and organization.

4. **Modularity**:
   - Break code into small, manageable functions or classes. Each function should perform a single task, making it easier to test and maintain.

5. **Commenting and Documentation**:
   - Use comments to explain why certain decisions were made, not just what the code does. Good documentation helps others (and yourself) understand the code later.

6. **Avoiding Code Duplication**:
   - Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Repeated code can lead to errors and makes maintenance harder.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling to anticipate and manage potential issues gracefully.

8. **Testing**:
   - Write automated tests to ensure code behaves as expected and to facilitate future changes without introducing bugs.

### Characteristics of Clean Code

- **Descriptive Names**: Use names that clearly describe the purpose of variables, functions, and classes.
  
- **Short Functions**: Functions should be short and focused. If a function is too long, consider breaking it into smaller ones.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function or module should have one responsibility or purpose.

- **Avoiding Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables to reduce dependencies and potential side effects.

- **Refactoring**: Regularly revisit and improve the codebase to enhance clarity and efficiency.
