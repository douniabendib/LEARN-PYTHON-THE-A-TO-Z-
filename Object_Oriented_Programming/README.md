# Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which can encapsulate both data and behavior. It allows for more organized, modular, and reusable code.

### Benefits of OOP

- **Modularity**: Code is organized into classes, making it easier to maintain and understand.
- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across different programs, reducing redundancy.
- **Flexibility**: OOP allows for the creation of code that is easier to modify and extend.
