# Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than functions and logic. In OOP, an object is a collection of data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

Python is an object-oriented language, which means everything in Python is an object - even integers, strings, and functions.

The key concepts in OOP include:

- Classes: Blueprints for creating objects
- Objects: Instances of classes
- Attributes: Data stored inside a class or object
- Methods: Functions defined inside a class

Here's a simple example of defining a class in Python:
```python
# Define a class named 'Person'
class Person:
    pass  # 'pass' is a placeholder that does nothing

# Create an object of the Person class
john = Person()
```
In the next lessons, we'll explore these concepts in depth and learn how to define attributes and methods for our classes.
