# Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than functions and logic. In OOP, an object is a collection of data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

Python is an object-oriented language, which means everything in Python is an object - even integers, strings, and functions.

The key concepts in OOP include:

- Classes: Blueprints for creating objects
- Objects: Instances of classes
- Attributes: Data stored inside a class or object
- Methods: Functions defined inside a class

Here's a simple example of defining a class in Python:
```python
# Define a class named 'Person'
class Person:
    pass  # 'pass' is a placeholder that does nothing

# Create an object of the Person class
john = Person()
```
In the next lessons, we'll explore these concepts in depth and learn how to define attributes and methods for our classes.

## Clean Code

Paradigms like object-oriented programming and functional programming are all about making code easier to work with. After all, programmers are just feeble humans. Code that's easy for humans to understand is called "clean code".

Clean Code Does Not:
- Make your programs run faster
- Make your programs function correctly
- Only occur in object-oriented programming

Clean Code Does:
- Make code easier to work with
- Make it easier to find and fix bugs
- Make the development process faster
Help us retain our sanity
