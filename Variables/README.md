# Chapter 2 : Variables

## What are Variables?
variable is a symbolic name associated with a value and is used to store data in a program.

### Key Characteristics of Variables:
-**Storage**: Variables act as storage locations for data values.

-**Naming**: Each variable has a name (identifier) that you use to access its value. Variable names must follow certain rules:
	-Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
	-Can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores.
	-Are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different variables).

-**Data Types**: Variables can store different types of data, including:
	-Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3)
	-Floats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
	-Strings: Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!")
	-Booleans: True or False values (e.g., True, False)

-**Dynamic Typing**:In languages like Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter determines the type based on the value assigned.
