# Python Numbers
In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:
- Addition
```python
2 + 1
# 3
```
- Subtraction
```python
2 - 1
# 1
```
- Multiplication
```python
2 * 2
# 4
```
- Division
```python
3 / 2
# 1.5 (a float)
```
