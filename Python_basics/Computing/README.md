# Python Numbers
In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called Integers - just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:
- Addition
```python
2 + 1
# 3
```
- Subtraction
```python
2 - 1
# 1
```
- Multiplication
```python
2 * 2
# 4
```
- Division
```python
3 / 2
# 1.5 (a float)
```

* Integers
In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called Integers.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.
* Floats
A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.
```python
my_int = 5
my_float = 5.5
```

# Floor Division
Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The // operator is used for floor division.
```python
7 // 3
# 2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
-7 // 3
# -3 (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)
```
# Exponents
Python has built-in support for exponents - something most languages require a math library for.
```python
# reads as "three squared" or
# "three raised to the second power"
3 ** 2
# 9
```
