# Basic Error Handling

## What is Error Handling?

Error handling is a crucial aspect of programming that involves responding to and recovering from error conditions in your code. In Python, errors are managed using a system of exceptions. An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions.

When an error occurs, Python creates an exception object. If the exception is not handled, the program will terminate and display an error message. Proper error handling allows your program to detect errors, handle them gracefully, and continue running.

Common types of exceptions include TypeError, ValueError, IOError, and ZeroDivisionError. For example, a TypeError occurs when an operation is performed on a value of an inappropriate type, and a ZeroDivisionError occurs when a number is divided by zero.

Here's a simple example of an error that occurs when trying to convert a string that does not represent a number into an integer:
```python
s = "abc"
n = int(s)  # This will raise a ValueError
print(n)
```
In this example, the int() function cannot convert the string "abc" into an integer, so it raises a ValueError. Without error handling, this exception would cause the program to crash.
